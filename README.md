[Web UI Role Description](https://www.notion.so/Web-User-Interface-Developer-Role-9978e2084bcc45a7a182638acf38b956 "Web UI Dev Role Description")


Pitch: 
It’s such a pain when you arrive at a networking event and realize you don’t have any business cards on you.  Or getting home and realizing that you left the stack of cards you collected on the hotel nightstand.  Enter a new business card organizing app. 



MVP:
Onboarding for a new user. 
User can go in and create their virtual business card, complete with their own QR code. 
User can show their virtual business card to another user, and the QR code can be scanned to automatically put that person’s business card in your collection.  
User can create events as a way to organize cards they’ve collected.  Ie ‘tech conference san francisco 2019’ and all scanned business cards during that event will be saved in that event space. 
Ability to edit and delete your virtual business card.
